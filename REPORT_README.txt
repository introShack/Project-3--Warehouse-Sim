After thorough analysis of the data gathered from the simulations run, 
the optimal dock range for the company to utilize is anywhere between seven and nine docks per warehouse. 
Based on the numbers generated, there is roughly a 37-35% loss of revenue based on the cost of maintaining a dock and unloading crates. 
The top performing dock counts were in the range of five and nine docks. Due to the high truck line count of smaller numbers of docks, 
the smaller dock counts were ruled out, resulting in a back-log of trucks that were not going to be finished by the end of the day. 
On the other end of things, however, a high dock count resulted in docks sitting idle and money being lost because of the need to maintain the docks present. By the end of the analysis, a count of seven docks resulted in the lowest loss of revenue with only a 34.58% loss. 
The recommendation, therefore, is to keep the dock count to anywhere between seven and nine docks (depending on the activity expected to be seen at the warehouse in question) to maximize efficiency and minimize loss of revenue.
